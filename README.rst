A new algorithm every day
-------------------------

This repo contains implementations of different algorithms in :code:`Python 3.6`

My goal is to add a new algorithm every day to this repo as long as I can as a challenge.
I will try to make my implementations as clean and readable as possible using best coding practices.

Feel free to use any of this code.

Current goals:

- 10 days :heavy_check_mark:
- 30 days
- 50 days
- 100 days
